## AI Commentary Examples

When commentary is enabled, the AI will provide entertaining feedback:

```
ðŸ’­ AI: That move was so predictable, I saw it coming three 
     turns ago!

ðŸ’­ AI: Bold choice! Let's see if you can back up that 
     confidence against me.

ðŸ’­ AI: Really? That's your grand strategy? I'm not impressed!
```
